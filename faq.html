            <button class="faq-question">What is the significance of zari work in Indian traditional clothing?</button><br>
                <label for="answer">
                    <fieldset>Zari work involves weaving threads of gold or silver into fabrics, adding a touch of opulence and grandeur. It is commonly used in sarees, lehengas, and sherwanis for weddings and festive occasions, symbolizing wealth and status.

                <button class="faq-question">How about packing?</button><br>
                <label for="answer">
                    <fieldset>Packing is our extreme concern. We take all steps to have your products delivered in a perfect and hygienic condition without any damage. We at Tredy Foods  strive to deliver the best product and in that endeavour we accept no compromises. As far as packing is concerned we have received feedback from our customers stating that the outer packing is done in a carton box and the look is not proportionate to the order size. We take this as a complement and the reason is we do not want any amount of rough handling to affect the quality, taste, look or texture of the food item in any case.
